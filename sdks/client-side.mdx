## Installation

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash npm
  npm i @restash/restash-js
  ```

  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm i @restash/restash-js
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn add @restash/restash-js
```

</CodeGroup>

## Basic usage
Here's a simple example of how to use the Restash client SDK to upload files directly from the browser.

```typescript
import { createRestashUploader } from "@restash/restash-js";

// create the uploader with your public API key
const upload = createRestashUploader({
  publicKey: "pk_123456789",
});

// can be a file or a blob
const file = new File(["test"], "test.txt", {
  type: "text/plain",
});

const result = await upload(file);

console.log(result.url); // https://cdn.restash.io/{result.key}
```

- [Signed uploads](/uploads/client-uploads#signed-uploads)

## Creating the uploader
The `createRestashUploader` function creates an uploader instance.
```typescript lib/restash.ts
import { createRestashUploader } from "@restash/restash-js";

export const upload = createRestashUploader({
  publicKey: "pk_123456789",
});
```
It accepts an options object with the following properties:

<ParamField body="publicKey" type="string" required>
  Your Restash public API key. This is required to authenticate the upload request.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="handleSignature" type="string">
  The URL of your server route that returns a signature and payload. Only required if your team has signature enforcement enabled. [Learn more](/uploads/client-uploads#signed-uploads).
</ParamField>

## Using the uploader
You can import your uploader instance and use it to upload files.
```typescript
import { upload } from "@/lib/restash";

const result = await upload(file, {
  path: "uploads/",
  onProgress: ({ percent }) => {
    console.log(`uploading...${percent}%`);
  },
});
```
It accepts the following parameters:

<ParamField body="file" type="File | Blob" required>
  The file or blob to upload.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="options" type="UploadOptions object">
  An object with the following optional properties:
  <Expandable title="properties">
    <ParamField body="name" type="string">
     A custom name for the file. This will override the original file name. If a blob is passed and no name is provided, we will generate a random name.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="path" type="string">
      Prefix the file name with a custom path. This is useful for organizing files in your Restash account. You can think of this as a folder structure.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="metadata" type="object">
      Key-value pairs of metadata associated with the file. This can be used to store additional information about the file.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="onProgress" type="function">
      A callback function that will be called with the progress of the upload. It receives an object with the following properties:
      <Expandable title="properties">
        <ParamField body="percent" type="number">
          The progress of the upload as a percentage.
        </ParamField>
        <ParamField body="loaded" type="number">
          The number of bytes uploaded so far.
        </ParamField>
        <ParamField body="total" type="number">
          The total number of bytes to be uploaded.
        </ParamField>
      </Expandable>
    </ParamField>
  </Expandable>
</ParamField>

A successful upload will respond with the following:

<ParamField body="data" type="UploadResult object">
  The information about the uploaded file.
  <Expandable title="properties">
    <ParamField body="id" type="string">
      The unique identifier of the uploaded file.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="name" type="string">
      The name of the uploaded file.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="url" type="string">
      The URL of the uploaded file.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="size" type="number">
      The size of the uploaded file in bytes.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="contentType" type="string">
      The content type of the uploaded file.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="key" type="string">
      The unique key of the uploaded file.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="metadata" type="object | null">
      Key-value pairs of metadata associated with the file.
    </ParamField>
  </Expandable>
</ParamField>

## Generating signatures
If your team has signature enforcement enabled, you need to generate a signature for each upload request. You can do this by creating a server route that returns a signature and payload
using the `generateSig` function from the Restash client SDK. Generating signatures needs to be done on the server. You can then pass this route to the `createRestashUploader` so that it can be called when needed.

 ```typescript /api/restash/signature/route.ts
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { generateSig } from "@restash/restash-js";

export const GET = () => {
  const secret = process.env.RESTASH_SECRET_KEY!;
  const { signature, payload } = generateSig(secret);

  return NextResponse.json({ signature, payload });
}
```
It accepts the following parameters:
<ParamField body="secret" type="string" required>
  Your Restash secret API key. This is required to generate the signature.
</ParamField>
