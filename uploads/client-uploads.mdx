Easily upload files directly from the browser with Restash.
This guide shows you how to set up client-side uploads using our lightweight SDK.

## Prerequisites

To follow this guide, you will need to:

- [Create a Restash account](https://restash.io/register)
- [Create an API key](https://restash.io/api-keys)

## Install and initialize the Restash uploader

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install">
    Install the Restash client SDK using your preferred package manager. Restash works with all Javascript front end
    frameworks.
    <CodeGroup>

      ```bash npm
      npm i @restash/client
      ```

      ```bash pnpm
      pnpm i @restash/client
      ```

      ```bash yarn
      yarn add @restash/client
      ```

      ```bash bun
      bun add @restash/client
      ```

    </CodeGroup>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Initialize Restash uploader">
    Initialize the uploader with your **public API key**

    ```javascript lib/restash.ts
    import { createRestashUploader } from "@restash/client";

    export const upload = createRestashUploader({
      publicKey: "pk_123456789"
  });
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Use the uploader">
    You can now import the uploader and use it to upload files.

    ```javascript
    import { upload } from "@/lib/restash";
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Uploading your first file

In this example, we will upload a file in Next.js

```typescript my-form.tsx
"use client";

import { upload } from "@/lib/restash";
import type { UploadResult } from "@restash/client";
import { useState, FormEvent } from "react";

export const ImageUploader = () => {
  const [newFile, setNewFile] = useState<UploadResult | null>(null);

  const onSubmit = async (e: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {
    e.preventDefault();

    const formData = new FormData(e.currentTarget);

    if (!formData.has("file")) {
      throw new Error("No file selected");
    }

    const file = formData.get("file") as File;

    const uploadedFile = await upload(file);
    setNewFile(uploadedFile);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Upload an image</h1>
      <form onSubmit={onSubmit}>
        <input name="file" type="file" required accept="image/*" />
        <button type="submit">Upload</button>
      </form>
      {newFile && (
        <img src={newFile.url} alt={newFile.name} />
      )}
    </>
  );
};
```

## Signed uploads

Enabling signed uploads for your team ensures that only your server can authorize uploads by requiring a secure signature for each request. This prevents abuse and gives you full control over who can upload.

## Implementing signed uploads

<Steps>
  <Step title="Require signed uploads for your team">
    Navigate to your [team settings](https://restash.io/settings) page and enforce signatures.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an endpoint to generate signatures" >
    Generate signatures using the `generateSig` function with your **secret key**.
    ```typescript /api/restash/signature/route.ts
    import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
    import { generateSig } from "@restash/client";

    export const GET = () => {
      const secret = process.env.RESTASH_SECRET_KEY!;
      const { signature, payload } = generateSig(secret);

      return NextResponse.json({ signature, payload });
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pass your endpoint the uploader">
    Pass your route to `createRestashUploader`
    ```typescript lib/restash.ts
    import { createRestashUploader } from "@restash/client";

    export const upload = createRestashUploader({
      publicKey: "pk_123456789",
      handleSignature: "/api/restash/signature"
  });
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
