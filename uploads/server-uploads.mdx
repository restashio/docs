Easily upload files from a Node.js server to Restash.
This guide shows you how to set up server-side uploads using our lightweight SDK.

<Note>
  You can only upload files up to 4MB on the server. If you want to upload files larger than 4MB,
  you can use the client side SDK to upload files directly from the browser.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

To follow this guide, you will need to:

- [Create a Restash account](https://restash.io/register)
- [Create an API key](https://restash.io/api-keys)

## Install and initialize Restash

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install">
    Install Restash Node using your preferred package manager.
    <CodeGroup>

      ```bash npm
      npm i @restash/node
      ```

      ```bash pnpm
      pnpm i @restash/node
      ```

      ```bash yarn
      yarn add @restash/node
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initialize Restash">
    Initialize Restash with your **private API key**.

    ```javascript lib/restash.ts
    import { Restash } from "@restash/node";

    export const restash = new Restash("sk_123456789");
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use Restash anywhere in your server code">
    You can now import Restash and use it to upload files.

    ```javascript
    import { restash } from "@/lib/restash";
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Uploading your first file on the server

In this example, we will upload a file inside a Next.js API route.

```typescript api/upload/route.ts
import { NextResponse, NextRequest } from "next/server";
import { restash } from "@/lib/restash";

export const POST = async (req: NextRequest) => {
  const formData = await req.formData();
  const file = formData.get("file") as File;

  const upload = await restash.files.upload(file);

  // store the upload in your db or do something else with it
  console.log(upload.url);

  return NextResponse.json(upload);
};
```
