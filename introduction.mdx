[Restash](https://restash.io) makes file uploads and delivery simple. No S3 configs, no CORS headaches, no complex setup. Upload files from your web app and serve them globally with just a few lines of code.

## Key features
Restash is great for storing all file types from images, videos, fonts, and any other asset.

- **Storage**: Store files using our [SDKs](/sdks/overview) or directly from our web app.
- **Global CDN**: All files are served from CloudFrontâ€™s worldwide edge network.
- **Browser uploads**: Upload files directly from the browser using our [client SDK](/sdks/client-side).
- **Server uploads**: Upload files from your server using our [server SDK](/sdks/node).
